# Front Matter

Documentation is not just a feature, but the first feature of your project most users interact with, because that's the first thing most of the times developers look for when trying to solve a problem.

# Understanding your audience

Breaking the knowledge curse, and writing effective documentation, requires empathy for your users.

To write good documentation for our users, there are several steps we need to go through:

- Defining your users' goals: What do you want your users to learn or to be able to accomplish after having read this documentation.

- Understanding who your users are: Knowing their roles, the existing knowledge they have, language that is familiar to them, and so on.

- Outline your users’ needs: Write down questions your users may have.

Creating user personas is also a way to try in detail better understanding your users. This could include their role, the programming knowledge they have, their developer environment and so on.

# Planning your documentation

There are multiple types of helpful documentation:

- Getting started: Often suited for first time users, trying to get started as quickly as possible.

- Conceptual: Here it isn't about implementation details, but helping users understand concepts and ideas of the project.

- Procedural: Documentation that include tutorials and how-to guides.

- Reference: Here it is about which actions produce which results. Should be a source to lean one once the user is ready to build.

- Troubleshooting: Common problems users may have, can include error messages, and how to debug/fix them with step by step instructions.

# Drafting documenation

You can start off by listing three points being the audience, purpose and content pattern (what type of documentation it is).

Creating a outline with simple points of what you wanna go over, with each outline later on having a more detailed description.

It is important to structure things in headers, and be simple plus consistent. As for paragraphs, we wanna avoid a wall of words, at the same time we should group things that are in the same context.

Callouts like **Note**, **Caution** or **Warning** are great to break the flow for the users in order to provide necessary information.

It is also a good idea to break up a long document into horizontal pieces.

Strive for simplicity and clarity.

Questions to check if you're done with your draft:

- Does the headline summarize the document’s goal?

- Do headings adequately summarize the document?

- Does your draft address your reader's needs from start to finish?

- Does the flow of information make sense to your reader?

- Does the draft address any issues you found in your friction log?

- Does your draft correctly follow any documentation patterns or a template?

- Have you tested and verified that any and all procedures work?

# Editing documentation

You want to edit for technical accuracy, completeness, structure and clarity.

- Make sure the code is properly written and explained, and that the instructions produce the results you promised your users.

- Make sure there aren't any TODO comments nor something that is still left open or needs more explanations due it being very vague.

- Make sure the structure is on point. The headers and their levels, making sure paragraphs are grouped correctly and avoiding a wall of words.

- Make sure you are clear to your users, avoid using slangs and try to keep the language simple.

You should also have a process where you do peer reviews, having your peers look at the documentation and pointing out what could be improve or ask questions which in turn could lead to to a clearer documentation.

# Integrating code samples

Your code samples sould be clear, concise and explained.

The explanations shouldn't be lengthy, since ideally the code with some comments should be self-explanatory.

Code should also be trustworthy, it is pastable and works as expected.

Use a descriptive code language and simple yet realistic examples.

Include the necessary information and exclude ranter or something that is unrelated.

It can also be good to have sandbox samples for people to play around with your stuff.
