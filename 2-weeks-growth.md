- Start learning canvas and build a brainstorming app. Maybe make it a multiplayer app using Liveblocks if I feel motivated enough. The deadline is the next two weeks, though, if I feel motivated to continue on it, I'm allowed another week.

- Start with https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/ (AWS version) and make sure to finish it within the next two weeks. Spend 3 hours on it every day, if there is a risk that it may not get done, spend 6 hours instead of 3 during the last 4 days of the 2 weeks.

- Once https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/ is done, start going through the book **Terraform: Up and Running, 3rd Edition** and try to finish it before October begins.

- Once the brainstorming app is done, design and build a new portfolio.

- Once the Portfolio is done, continue building projects.
