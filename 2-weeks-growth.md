# First week

- Deadline for the Netflix clone.

- Make sure to learn AWS 1h every morning, ideally another hour during the day, take a timer and do focused work.

# Second Week

- Thursday is the latest day for starting with the Terraform book, which I should continue on for 1 - 2 weeks.

- Start a project in Canvas, try to build something similar to Excalidraw/Miro.

- Finish Blog post "6 months at Bobsled" and publish it.

# Future

- The goal is before October starts to start designing and developing my new portfolio.

- After that, the goal will be to step away from TypeScript for quite some time.

I still have a few things I want to develop, like that typing game for toddlers for example.
