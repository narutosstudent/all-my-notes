# Focus on High-Leverage Activities

Effective engineers aren't trying to get more work done by putting more hours in, rather they try to get things done efficiently and focus their limited time on the tasks that produce the most value.

Effective engineers assess their leverage. Leverage is the value or impact, produced per time invested.

Pareto principle is a different way of thinking about leverage, 80-20 rule, the notion that for many activities, 80% of the impact comes from 20% of the work.

An example would be to spent more time training and mentoring new engineers, it may not require much time to do so, but definitely will have a great impact.

Questions we can ask ourselves on any activities we are working on:

1. How can I complete this activity in a shorter amount of time?

2. How can I increase the value produced by this activity?

3. Is there something else that I could spend my time on that would produce
   more value?

# Optimize for Learning

Optimise early for learning as it has a compound effect. The more knowledge you gain the easier it'll be to gain the other knowledge, form habits that allow you to learn consistently. Make sure to run after challenges at work and do things you haven't tackled before. The more uncomfortable you're at work, or rather at the task you're doing, the more growth.

Foster a culture of curiosity, a culture of openess where it is encouraged to ask questions and give feedback.

# Prioritize Regularly

Priotize tasks that directly produce value.

Don't try to get everything done, focus on what matters and what matters is what produces value.

Limit the amount of work in progress, and do your best at one thing:

When we work on too many things simultaneously, we spend most of
our brain’s mental energy moving actors on and off the stage rather than
paying attention to their performance.

# Invest in Iteration Speed

If you're doing something manually multiple times, make sure to automate it the third time.

CD is very valuable, allows you to get immediate feedback from customers upon finishing a feature, also you won't need to worry about manual deployment.

Find the bottleneck you have as an engineer, and do your best to eliminate it. Always strive to improve and focus on strengthening your weaknesses, whether it be working with version control, using the keyboard more, automating manual tasks of yours, learning a new programming language.

# Measure What You Want to Improve

If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. Use metrics to drive progress.

# Validate Your Ideas Early and Often

Approach a problem iteratively to reduce wasted effort. Each iteration provides opportunities to validate new ideas. Iterate quickly to learn quickly.

Reduce the risk of large implementations by using small validations.

Invest a little extra effort to figure out if the rest of your plan is worth doing (spikes).

Adopt a willingness to validate your decisions. Rather than making an important decision and moving on, set up feedback loops that enable you to collect data and assess your work’s value and effectiveness.
