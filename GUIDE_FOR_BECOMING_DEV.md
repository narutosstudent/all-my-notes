# Introduction

I genuinely believe that within 12 months you can become a software developer, specifically, a frontend developer (a developer developing User Interfaces and working with what the end users often end up seeing displayed on the screen). I was inspired to write this article since I'm slowly helping more and more people around the transition into tech.

Now, you may wonder if it is possible, to become a software developer within 12 months and **transform** your current life? The answer is YES, it is totally possible and many developers have done so, taught themselves how to code and changed their lives, in less than 12 months. Some even get their first job after 3 - 6 months of grinding like crazy, though I will say in my opinion and from my experience as a self-taught developer that dropped out of high school, it is not easy. I think a solid goal and deadline to set for yourself is a year, more than a year it shouldn't take in my opinion if you've worked focused and followed a structured plan.

I will say it is gonna require discipline and you put in the work. Don't give up, believe in yourself, and know nothing good comes out of quitting.

I will go through some weeks and some months, this article is aimed to be a guide, and not a detailed structure giving you the exact courses, books or workshops to go through. From my experience both learning to code and helping people around me, people often need guidance, and then the rest they can often figure out themselves by i.e. using google and doing research (there are lots of resources out there, both free and paid, to learn almost any technology or tool in tech).

Now, in this article, I won't cover stuff like writing your resume, what should be on your portfolio, or how to act in interviews, rather again as mentioned, this is guidance, though, if I know a resource that I trust from experience, I'll share it, like specific workshops over at Frontend Masters.

I'll go through everything order by order, we'll learn numerous stuff, the main goal is for you within 12 months to become a paid frontend developer! This is the GUIDE I would've given my younger self!

_The number, in the end, is the total months calculated for that phase._

_If You manage to learn or accomplish things quicker than they are structured and feel confident to move on to the next phase, feel free to do so! Also, know that this isn't the only path, feel free to tweak this path to fit into your life and whatever goals or deadlines you have set for yourself!_

_This is the guide I wish I had read before starting to code. Specifically, before the time I decided to take coding seriously in fact, since this is gonna require discipline and work ethic, it is a commitment._

Some stuff you will learn:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Git & Github
- TypeScript
- Accessibility

## Tooling & environment (0.5 months) 0.5

We're gonna start by learning the tooling and environment you will work with and in as a developer.

### VS Code

Install the code editor that you will use, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), you will write your code here.

### Git & Github

As a developer, you will always use Git and Github for your project. Git is in short a tool to help you track and manage the work of your project. Github is a platform where developers can publish their code and document their projects. They can also use Github to collaborate with other developers.

### Practice on text files (.txt)

Now that you have VS Code and also know some Git & Github, you're gonna put that into practice. Start off by editing text files in VS Code, committing and eventually pushing them up to Github. The goal isn't to write any code yet, the goal here is to get you familiar with the coding tools first, so you don't get overwhelmed trying to learn both coding and the tools at the same time.

### Important note

When you're building projects over the next phases, make sure to always create a Github repository and commit your stuff, even from the very beginning!

## Basic HTML & CSS (1 month) 1.5

Learn the basics of HTML and CSS. You should do a few tutorials, try to timebox all of them for a maximum of two weeks, then spend two weeks building stuff. You must spend more time building stuff during each phase of this guidance than doing tutorials. You need some knowledge to get going, but celebrate the struggle, it is when you learn and grow, struggling means you're on the right path!

I'd recommend starting by learning HTML first separately, then you can learn CSS. Learning both at the same time can be difficult.

## Intermediate/Advanced HTML & CSS (2 months) 3.5

After you've built your first basic websites, it is time to move on to building more intermediate stuff. This includes for example Responsive Websites (mobile & desktop friendly), Flexbox, Grid, Positioning, Transitions, Animations, Advanced Selectors, Units and more!

I'm gonna recommend resources that are both free and paid. In your position, I would've started with some of the free ones, build stuff for a while, then do the paid resources. My favorite CSS course is the first paid one: **CSS - The Complete Guide 2022 (incl. Flexbox, Grid & Sass)**.

Make sure that you're spending more time building stuff than doing tutorials! It is fine if you do for example one tutorial, and then spend the rest of the time building, and challenging yourself to build more complex & comprehensive websites.

Be aware not to fall into the trap of trying to get things too perfect and losing a bunch of time. Done is better than perfect.

I'd strongly advise you to check out the Youtube of Kevin Powell as well, he explains numerous CSS concepts amazingly: [Playlists by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob/playlists?view=1&sort=dd&shelf_id=0)

## Basic JavaScript (0.5 months) 4

Now it is time to learn some basic javascript for the first two weeks. The goal is to do a basic tutorial and then play around with JavaScript a bit.

## JavaScript & DOM (1.5 months) 5.5

## Intermediate/Advanced JavaScript (2 months) 7.5

## TypeScript (0.5 months) 8

## Portfolio and Resume (1 month) 9

Testing basics, and add some testing to existing React projects.

Once done if time is enough, build a fullstack project using React, TypeScript, Firebase, a styling or component library (Material UI, Tailwind, Chakra UI, )
