# AWS Overview

## Lesson 1

AWS stands for Amazon Web Services. It has over 200 features. It is the most used cloud platform.

There is a shared responsibility model. AWS is responsible for the security of the cloud. The customer is responsible for security in the cloud.

AWS:

- Make sure that the hardware and global infrastructure of AWS works. Such as regions, availability zones and edge locations. This also makes sure that they are used when they are supposed to be used.
- Make sure that the software side of things works too, like databases, storage, networking and so on. Access should only be given to those who have the right roles. They should be secure and robust.

Customer:

- Responsible for the customer data.
- Server and client-side encryption.
- Network and firewall configuration.

The fundamental unit of AWS is the AWS account. It is like a container for all your AWS resources. It is a unit of organization, billing and access. From your account, you can grant permissions to isolate your workload.

AWS accounts have one root user. They have a unique email for only that specific account. They have billing information. You will also need contact information for your AWS account for it to be fully provisioned.

Each resource in AWS has a globally unique identifier called Amazon Resource Name (ARN). ARN model: `arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource-id`.
