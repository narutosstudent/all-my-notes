The basis of the Toyota production system is the absolute elimination of waste.

The two pillars needed to support the system are:

- Just-in-time

- Autonomation

Repeating why 5 times can help discover the root of a problem. Fixing that would help avoid the same problem happening all over again.

More manpower doesn't equal more work being done, in fact often the opposite, more work may get done but this also comes with more waste. Work that is needed is the real work and the rest would be a waste, meaning present capacity is always equal to work and waste combined, the goal is to reduce the waste as much as possible.

Wastes to identify:

- Waste of overproduction

- Waste of time on hand (waiting)

- Waste in transportation

- Waste of processing itself

- Waste of stock on hand (inventory)

- Waste of movement

- Waste of making defective products

Eliminating wasteful and meaningless jobs enhances the value of work for workers.
