In this article, I want to share some of my thoughts on dropping out of high school, and whether it is for everyone and if it is something I recommend or not.

Honestly, I find it tragic that many successful high school dropouts do not recommend dropping out.

# Why I dropped out

# Benefits of dropping out

# Do your options become limited?
