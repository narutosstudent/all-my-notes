In this article, I want to share how I enjoy working with CSS. I really love working this way as it is quite effective and simple.

In one of my previous articles, I spoke about why I have gone back to working with vanilla CSS from being a fan of Tailwind CSS.

You can read it here: [Why I prefer vanilla CSS over Tailwind](https://tigerabrodi.blog/why-i-prefer-vanilla-css-over-tailwind).

# Classes

I enjoy following the BEM convention, though, I don't strictly stick to it. Honestly, I don't even remember the details of BEM convention, but that's where I got it.

Let me share an example.

```js
<div class="card">
  <h1 class="card__title">Title</h1>
  <h2 class="card__subtitle">Subtitle</h2>
  <div class="card__actions">
    <button class="card__actions-close">Close</button>
    <button class="card__actions-save">Save</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

As for the CSS styles, I'll have them in a separate CSS file.

# Dev Tools

Let's go over how I enjoy working with the Dev Tools when styling my content.

# Conclusion

Yep, that's it. I love working this way, and it really is vanilla CSS.

Simple & elegant.
