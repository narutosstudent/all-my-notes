In this article, I want to talk about blog-driven development. Now, the concept of blog-driven development has probably existed for a while now. I'm honestly not sure if that is what you call it, but whatever, lets call it that for now.

I want to go over one of the best strategies for learning and mastering something as a programmer, and also tell you why you should have your own blog.

# Why have a blog?

## Storage of Knowledge

By writing about the stuff you've learned, you store your learnings, your knowledge, in a single place that is always accessible to you which you can refer to whenever you need it.

It's funny how many times I've referred to my older blog posts. It is like my past self helping my current self. It truly makes you grateful for having written those articles.

From my experience, your blog sort of becomes like your second brain, I'm not sure if that's how I'd describe it, or perhaps we could describe it as your own, public digital library.

## Reinforcement

By writing about the stuff you learn, you will better remember them. When you're writing about something, through out the process of writing, you will think about and reread your content a lot.

If you decide to do research, and look things up, possibly to drop references in your article, that will eventually help you understand things better, and possibly even clarify some of the existing knowledge you've had.

# Best strategy for learning

The best strategy, at least from my experience, which I learned from [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/):

1. Learn
2. Build
3. Teach

We're gonna focus on the 3rd point, but essentially learn something via a resource (tutorial, book...), build projects with the thing you learned, then write about it.

Writing will help you better understand the stuff you've learned and remember them.
