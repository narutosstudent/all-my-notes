So, the adventure I recently joined, or as we call it over at Bobsled, joining the **sled**.

I joined Bobsled as their first employee, in this article I want to talk about the first 6 months over there, from March to September.

# What is Bobsled?

Bobsled is an early-stage start-up where we're developing the fastest way to share data to any cloud or platform.

> Sharing data in the cloud can be manual, expensive, slow, and fragile. Bobsled removes the friction from sharing data in the cloud, enabling data teams to focus on value-added work.

Bobsled will revolutionize the world by letting companies exchange data faster, leading them to making decisions faster and ultimately making more money and better decisions.

# How & Why did I join?

[Andrew Jeffreson](https://twitter.com/EastlondonDev), our CTO at Bobsled, contacted me via email, telling me about this exciting oppoturnity. We continued chatting over the details on Discord.

After hearing that all criterias I'm looking for were met, I got excited about the oppoturnity, as well as the chance to be the first employee of a possible unicorn.

Criterias I was looking for before joining any company:

- Salary
- Company (is it something I want to represent)
- Work (technologies and what I'll do)
- Team (team members and how we work)
- Project (is it something I believe in and will wake up every day with excitement to work on it)
- Career (how can I grow here)

I had 3 interviews in Bobsled, it went quite smooth and fast.

There were many other exciting companies in the pipeline that I was interviewing with, and offers I had gotten that also met all criterias, though, Bobsled was once in a lifetime oppoturnity, being the first employee of a possible unicorn, I know that I'd likely never get that ever in my life.

# Work I have done

The first 1.5 months at Bobsled it was just me and Andrew working on the product. We started the project from scratch with Remix as another project in our monorepo which uses Turborepo. Andrew was doing a bunch of other stuff, we would pair code 3 - 5 times weekly and I'd primarily during this time work solo on the product with him reviewing the code and me at times merging the PRs myself.

Among the technologies we use in the product (the app with Remix) are Material UI, Firebase, TypeScript, Zod, Memory Cache, Cypress/Testing Library (for testing) and many more.

Our monorepo contains other projects & packages like our reconciler, firebase library, schemas and other things that deal with the cloud infrastructure.

After 1.5 months another engineer joined our team, and as time passed till September, our team grew and we were around 10 engineers working on different parts of the codebase.

An overview of the work I've done over the past 6 months:

- Helping out with recruiting
- Setting up the Remix app from scratch and working on it
- Documented our code conventions
- Given feedback to the design
- Helped with the onboarding process
- Made sure our site is accessible and tested time to time with Voice Over screen reader
- Setting up our Cypress tests with Testing Library ensuring we query our elements using accessible queries
- Fixed performance bottlenecks found after testing pages with Lighthouse

# Work & Life

My routine at Bobsled has shifted time to time, as I'm also grinding in my spare time, hence I gotta be very wise with how I use my time. This way I can perform well during work and outside work too.

Fundamental points that I need in my life in order to not burnout.

- Staying hydrated
- Working out every day
- Getting good sleep (7h-8h)
- Taking my mid-day nap (30 - 60 minutes)
- Not stressing about things

Usually I'll wake up around 5am, and work on other stuff i.e. side projects, blog posts, etc. till 9am. From 9am onwards I'll focus on working on Bobsled with a mid-day nap and a workout around noon.

I'll usually stop working around 8pm, which is 1 hour before I head to bed. Take into account, some time goes away due to the mid-day nap and noon workout, so I'm not grinding 11h straight, otherwise I probably would've been dead a long time ago.

This routine works fantastic for me, and has given me a lot of success.

# My future

I'm excited about my future at Bobsled, and see where we're heading. I genuinely believe we will become a unicorn one day, things are going fantastic for us (can't say the details).

It is a unique position where I get to work with smart people and solve a revolutionary problem with a great vision.

Feeling blessed and excited, every day.
