We need to become experts at learning to succeed in software engineering.

We need to become experts at managing complexity since it is inevitable. As the software grows, so does the complexity of it.

# Introduction

> Software engineering is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software.

Five techniques that form the roots of learning:

- Iteration
- Feedback
- Incrementalism
- Experimentation
- Empiricism

To become experts of managing complexity we need:

- Modularity
- Cohesion
- Separation of Concerns
- Abstraction
- Loose Coupling
